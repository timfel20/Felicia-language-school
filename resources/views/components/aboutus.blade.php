            We are the FLC. We are a unique partnership of language trainers. 
            We were born from the marriage of a speech therapist and a language trainer.
            We dwell in the Beurs van Berlage, in the centre of Amsterdam. 
            We are here to help you with your voice, your speech and your language. We are the Amsterdam Language Centre.
